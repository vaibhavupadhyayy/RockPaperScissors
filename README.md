# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview
This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I worked on this project late last night to bring a classic game to life using modern web technologies.

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Choose either Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking on the corresponding button.
3. The computer will randomly choose its move.
4. The result of the round will be displayed on the screen.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Used for structuring the web page.
- CSS: Applied for styling and layout.
- JavaScript: Implemented game logic and interactivity.

## Features
- User-friendly interface.
- Randomized computer moves for unpredictability.
- Real-time result display.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: Stylesheet for designing the user interface.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for game logic and interactivity.

Start playing and have fun! ðŸŽ®
